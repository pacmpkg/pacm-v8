# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The pacm-v8 crate follows semantic versioning. We provide security updates for the latest patch release of the most recent minor version. Older releases may receive fixes at the maintainers' discretion.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| latest  | ✅ |
| < latest | ⚠️ Best effort |

If you rely on older releases, consider backporting fixes or upgrading regularly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

1. Email the maintainers at [security@pacmpkg.org](mailto:security@pacmpkg.org) with a detailed description of the issue, proof of concept, and any potential impact.
2. Expect an acknowledgment within 3 business days.
3. We will investigate and provide an initial assessment within 10 business days.
4. Once a fix is available, we will coordinate disclosure and release timing with you.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer English for security disclosures, but we will make a best effort to work with you in another language if needed.

## Public Disclosure

We will not publicly disclose a vulnerability without prior coordination and consent from the reporter unless required by policy or law. Reporters will be credited in release notes unless anonymity is requested.
